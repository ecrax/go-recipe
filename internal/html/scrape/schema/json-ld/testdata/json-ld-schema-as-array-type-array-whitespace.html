"reviewBody": "Great proportions! I have been searching for an alfredo recipe that isn't too heavy, or with too many extra ingredients, and this is it. Cooks note - be sure to try the sauce before adding any seasoning. I found that by using salted butter and a good quality parmesan there wasn't any need to add extra salt. Also saut√©ing the garlic in the butter before adding the cream added just the right amount of garlic taste to the sauce without it being overpowering. I'll be making this again!"

"reviewBody": "As written, the recipe is a touch bland (but not overly so). I tend to go a little heavier on the cheese, and I also add a little flavor with a dash of salt and pepper. Livens the sauce up a bit. Also, if you‚Äôre having issues with the cheese being clumpy and not melting properly, the reason may be that you‚Äôre using pre-shredded cheese. Suppliers put anticoagulants on the shredded cheese to prevent it from sticking and melting back together, which inhibits its use in sauce. You shouldn‚Äôt have any issues if you buy a wedge and grate it yourself."

"reviewBody": "If you can't make a killer sauce from this recipe you can only be using low quality ingredients. A great parmesan cheese will make all the difference. And butter, only butter. NEVER, EVER stray from the path with something like margarine. Even half &amp; half works great but never milk. The sauce is all about rich creaminess. That's the butter and cream doing their job. The cheese and garlic gives it that twang that makes this sauce so sublime. Plus it takes a little practice. Getting the heat right . . maybe a little salt and/or pepper and timely serving all matter. Your pasta should be almost done as you start."

This recipe is simple and easy to remember and can be personalized depending on the tastes of the cook and the dish being made. I made some changes such as using a mixture of milk and cream cheese in lieu of heavy cream, adding more butter and about two tablespoons of flour, and adding spices such as pepper, garlic salt, and fresh oregano. I read the recipe ahead of time and could see that it would taste a bit bland and was prepared for that. The cook is also supposed to taste the dish before hand and make adjustments as needed so it's not the recipes fault if you and your family didn't like it. I will be using this recipe again."

I melted my butter in a saucepan then added 2 cloves minced fresh garlic, 1 cup half &amp; half and 1/2 cup reduced fat milk. I kept on medium heat until I saw bubbles in the sauce. I then transferred the sauce mixture to the saut√©ed mushrooms. Since I couldn‚Äôt find a block of Parmesan cheese I used 1/2 cup of 4C grated Romano and Parmesan. I whisked the mixture for about 5 minutes while my pasta cooked. I didn‚Äôt mix the sauce and pasta together. I added the sauce on top of my pasta. I didn‚Äôt use salt as there‚Äôs salt in butter and cheese. I added about 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper. I noticed others say to add nutmeg so I‚Äôll try that next time. I enjoyed a lower fat version. I will try real Parmesan and perhaps Gruy√®re cheese next time. All in all not bad for a first time effort."

Hubby loved it, teen daughter tried it but prefers the orig. I‚Äôve got to find a way to make a lower cal version but until then &amp; for a special treat, this sauce is Well Worth the calories."

I melted the butter and my fresh clove of garlic, added the milk and fat free half and half, then before it had a chance to get hot I poured a cup of that into a glass jar and shook it very hard with a table spoon or two of flower, then I returned it to the pot and stirred and heated with about a 1/2 C of parsely until it thickened - was pretty fast...I added the shredded parmesan, I saw that the sauce was SUPER thick...so I boiled a big bag of frozen spinach WITH my angel hair pasta and drained...I stired the alfredo sauce in and it was so good....nobody in my family could stop eating it...even our neighbor who popped in, kept asking for more and more helpings....even though he was on his way to a Chinese New Year feast! LOL! This was TOP notch! I'm so glad it was a success even though I didn't have cream! I served it with Salmon poached in some kind of a delicious orange(colored) lemon coconut sauce from Aldies....and it was a HUGE hit - and in my opinion super healthy too!"
